# Azure Linux Ubuntu

## Install Azure CLI on Windows

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli



## VSC Terminal Shell Integration

By default, the shell integration script should automatically activate on supported shells launched from VS Code.

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration

## Bash it, Git BASH

Git for Windows provides a BASH emulation used to run Git from the command line. *NIX users should feel right at home, as the BASH emulation behaves just like the "git" command in LINUX and UNIX environments.

1. Filesystem Hierarchy

| Path     | Description
|----------| -----------------------------------------------
| /        | - The root directory of the entire filesystem hierarchy, everything is nestled under this directory.
| /bin -   | Essential ready-to-run programs (binaries), includes the most basic commands such as ls and cp.
| /boot -  | Contains kernel boot loader files.
| /dev -   | Device files.
| /etc -   | Core system configuration directory, should hold only configuration files and not any binaries.
| /home -  | Personal directories for users, holds your documents, files, settings, etc.
| /lib -   | Holds library files that binaries can use.
| /media - | Used as an attachment point for removable media like USB drives.
| /mnt -   | Temporarily mounted filesystems.
| /opt -   | Optional application software packages.
| /proc -  | Information about currently running processes.
| /root -  | The root user's home directory.
| /run -   | Information about the running system since the last boot.
| /sbin -  | Contains essential system binaries, usually can only be ran by root.
| /srv -   | Site-specific data which are served by the system.
| /tmp -   | Storage for temporary files
| /usr -   | This is unfortunately named, most often it does not contain user files in the sense of a home folder. This is meant for user installed software and utilities, however that is not to say you can't add personal directories in there. Inside this directory are sub-directories for /usr/bin, /usr/local, etc.
| /var -  | Variable directory, it's used for system logging, user tracking, caches, etc. Basically anything that is subject to change all the time.

## Script bash, permission and run it


1. touch myScript.sh

2. nano myScript.sh

3. which bash, /bin/bash

```bash

#!/bin/bash

echo "Start script"

sleep 3

echo "End script"

```

3. Run it
```bash

# Run it 1
bash myScript.sh
# Run it 2, Permission denied
./myScript.sh
# Get permission
ls -l
# -rw-r--r-- no execute, add it
sudo chmod +x myScript.sh
# Get permission
ls -l
# -rwxr-xr-r- 
# Run it 3
./myScript.sh

# When we write functions and shell scripts, in which arguments are passed in to be processed, 
# the arguments will be passed int numerically-named variables, e.g. $1, $2, $3
myScript.sh oil gas

# The variable reference, $0, will expand to the current script's name, e.g. my_script.sh

```
myScript.sh
```bash
  GNU nano 6.2                                                                                                          myScript.sh
#!/bin/bash


echo "Input1: $1";
echo "Input2: $2"
### Turn OFF debug mode ###
set +x
# Add more commands without debug mode
result="Combined: $1 and $2"
echo "$result"
echo "cat to var contains:"
rv=$(cat numbers.txt)
echo "$rv"
echo "check sub str in str"
str="Oil is here"
check_it="Oil"
if [[ "$str" =~ .*"$check_it".* ]]; then
   echo "It is here"
```

Bash variables and command substitution

```bash

varName=someValue

# Variables
var_a=Hello # (notice no space)
var_b="Hello World"
n=10
inp="/Home/sales/data.txt"
NOW=$(date)
# Referencing the value of a variable

# # not advisable unless you know what the variable contains
echo $var_a 
# use
echo "$var_a"
echo "$var_b"
echo "$n"
echo "$inp"
echo $NOW

```

Valid variable names
* Should start with either an alphabetical letter or an underscore
* hey, x9, THESQL_STRING, _secret
* Variables names are case-sensitive, just like filenames.


```bash
vech=
echo "$vech"

vech=test
echo "$vech"
test

# Generating Output With printf command
# printf does not provide a new line. 
# You need to provide format string using % directives and escapes to format numeric and string arguments in a 
# way that is mostly similar to the C printf() function

# Format control string syntax is as follows:
printf "%w.pL\n" $varName
# w - Minimum field width.
# p - Display number of digits after the decimal point (precision).
# L - a conversion character. , s - String, d - Integer, e - Exponential, f - Floating point

vech="Car"
printf "%s\n" $vech
Car

printf "%s10.5\n" $vech
Car10.5

no=10
printf "%d\n" $no
10

big=5355765
printf "%e\n" $big
5.355765e+06

sales=25.123
printf "%.f\n" $sales
25
printf "%.2f\n" $sales
25.12

```

Default shell variables value

```bash

echo $shellvar

echo ${shellvar:-DefaultValueHere}
DefaultValueHere

# if $ name is not set use default
echo ${shellvar=Terminator 2}
Terminator 2

# if $ unset, set name to default 
echo ${shellvar:=Terminator 2}

echo $shellvar

# The := syntax
# If the variable is an empty, you can assign a default value. The syntax is:
${var:=defaultValue}

```

The internal field separator
* The global variable IFS is what Bash uses to split a string of expanded into separate words
* By default, the IFS variable is set to three characters: newline, space, and the tab. If you echo $IFS, you won't see anything because those characters


Quoting

```bash
echo "$PATH"
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin

echo /etc/*.conf
/etc/adduser.conf /etc/ca-certificates.conf /etc/debconf.conf /etc/deluser.conf [...]

echo "Path: $PATH"
Path: /usr/local/sbin: [...]

echo 'Path: $PATH'
Path: $PATH

```
The Backslash

```bash
# The backslash ( \ ) alters the special meaning of the ' and " i.e. it will escape or cancel the special meaning of the next character.
\b     backspace
\e     an escape character
\n     new line
\r     carriage return
\t     horizontal tab
\v     vertical tab
\\     backslash
\'     single quote
echo "Pizza bill \$22.5"
echo "CIFS path must be \\\\NT-Server-Name\\ShareName"
echo -e "Sr.no\t DVD (price) "

```

Export

```bash
export backup="/nas10/mysql"
echo "bck $backup"
# list all vlocal vars
export
[...]
declare -x backup="/nas10/mysql"
```

Getting User Input Via Keyboard and IFS

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Read txt
read -p "Enter db name: " name
read -s -p "Enter password: " my_password
echo "Password: $my_passsord"
echo "Db: $name. Do stuff."

# Read nr
read -p "Enter ID one: " n1
read -p "Enter ID two: " n2
read -p "Enter ID three: " n3
echo "ID : $n1, $n2, $n3"

# IFS, the IFS variable worked as token delimiter or separator.
echo "IFS: $IFS .You will see a whitespace which is nothing but a space, a tab, and a newline (default). "

nameservers="ns1.nixcraft.net ns2.nixcraft.net ns3.nixcraft.net"
echo "$nameservers"
read -r ns1 ns2 ns3 <<< "$nameservers"
echo "DNS #1: $ns1"
echo "DNS #2: $ns2"
echo "DNS #3: $ns3"

# Change IFS separator
pwd="gitevivek:x:1002:1002::/home/gitevivek:/bin/sh"
old="$IFS"
echo "$IFS"
# Set IFS to :
IFS=:
read -r login password uid gid info home shell <<< "$pwd"
echo "$login, $password, $uid, $gid, $info, $home, $shell"

# Array -a
# Set the IFS to split on whitespace
IFS=$'\n'
words="one two three"
read -r -a words <<< "$words"
echo "${words[@]}"

# Make array
arr=("one" "two" "three")
echo "${arr[1]}"


```
Perform arithmetic operations
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Create an integer variable
declare -i sale=100
declare -i bonus=12
total=$(( sale + bonus))
echo "Total sum int = $total"

# input
# input
read -p "Enter two numbers: " x y
ans=$(( x + y ))
echo "$x + $y = $ans"

## Setting Up Environment Variables on Ubuntu

```bash
# To view all the environment variables
printenv
# or
env

# Setting Environment Variables Temporarily
export MY_VAR="GOT"
printenv MY_VAR

# Setting Environment Variables Permanently
# For system-wide environment variables, edit the /etc/environment file.
sudo nano /etc/environment
MY_VAR="GOT"
# Save and exit the file. For the changes to take effect, either reboot the system or run:
source /etc/environment

# Verify it
printenv
MY_VAR=GOT

# Do a reboot and to be sure and verify it
sudo shutdown -r now
printenv
MY_VAR=GOT
```

## Linux disks and path/folder information
| The "thing mentioned"     | Description | Example
| -------------------------| ----------- | -------
|/dev/sda | The OS disk is labeled,/dev/sda. OS disk should not be used for applications or data. For applications and data, use data disks | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-manage-disks *
|/dev/sdb | Temporary disks use a solid-state drive that is located on the same Azure host as the VM. Temp disks are highly performant and may be used for operations such as temporary data processing.| mountpoint of /mnt *
|/dec/sdc | Data disk(s) | Attach disk at VM creation or Attach disk to existing VM, Prepare data disks, Mount and /etc/fstab
|Linux drive letter | Applications and users should not care what SCSI device letter a particular storage gets, because those sdX letters can change and are expected to change. Instead, the storage should be addressed by some unique and permanent property, such as the LUN WWID or filesystem UUID.| https://access.redhat.com/discussions/6004221

## Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 20.04

* Step 1 — Logging in as root

The root user is the administrative user in a Linux environment that has very broad privileges.

The next step is setting up a new user account with reduced privileges for day-to-day use.

Once you are logged in as root, you’ll be able to add the new user account. In the future, we’ll log in with this new account instead of root.

* Step 2 — Creating a New User

```bash
# become root
sudo -i
adduser username
# or
sudo adduser username
# list user
getent passwd username

```
* Step 3 — Granting Administrative Privileges

To avoid having to log out of our normal user and log back in as the root account, we can set up what is known as superuser or root privileges for our normal account. 

This will allow our normal user to run commands with administrative privileges by putting the word sudo before the command.

```bash
# become root
sudo -i
usermod -aG sudo username
# Now, when logged in as your regular user, you can type sudo before commands to run them with superuser privileges.

# change to user
su - username

# apt install
apt install zip
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), are you root?
sudo apt install zip

```
* Step 4 — Setting Up a Basic Firewall, UFW, or Uncomplicated Firewall

(
    
    Note: ufw by default is initially disabled. 

    ref https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/security-firewall#:~:text=ufw%20%2D%20Uncomplicated%20Firewall,by%20default%20is%20initially%20disabled

    Note: using IPV6

    ref https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-with-ufw-on-ubuntu-22-04

)

```bash
# Applications can register their profiles with UFW upon installation. These profiles allow UFW to manage these applications by name.
sudo ufw app list
Available applications:
  OpenSSH

# We need to make sure that the firewall allows SSH connections so that we can log back in next time. We can allow these connections by typing:
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
Rules updated
Rules updated (v6)

# Afterwards, we can enable the firewall by typing:
sudo ufw enable
Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)? y
Firewall is active and enabled on system startup

#
sudo ufw status
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)

```
As the firewall is currently blocking all connections except for SSH, if you install and configure additional services, you will need to adjust the firewall settings to allow traffic in.

You can learn some common UFW operations in our https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ufw-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands


* Step 5 — Enabling External Access for Your Regular User

```bash
# Now that we have a regular user for daily use, we need to make sure we can SSH into the account directly.

# 1. If you logged in to your root account using a password, then password authentication is enabled for SSH. 

ssh username@ip-address

# Remember, if you need to run a command with administrative privileges, type sudo before it like this:
sudo command_to_run

# 2. If you logged in to your root account using SSH keys, then password authentication is disabled for SSH. You will need to add a copy of your local public key to the new user’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file to log in successfully.

## Learn to use Bash with the Azure CLI (quick guide)

Azure CLI reference commands can execute in several different shell environments, but Microsoft Docs primarily use the Bash environment. If you are new to Bash and also the Azure CLI, you will find this article a great place to begin your learning journey. Work through this article much like you would a tutorial, and you'll soon be using the Azure CLI in a Bash environment with ease.

* Query results as JSON dictionaries or arrays
* Format output as JSON, table, or TSV
* Query, filter, and format single and multiple values
* Use if/exists/then and case syntax
* Use for loops
* Use grep, sed, paste, and bc commands
* Populate and use shell and environment variables

## Python with cron

Install cron and make it roll :large_blue_circle:
```bash
sudo apt install cron
sudo systemctl enable cron
Synchronizing state of cron.service with SysV service script with /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
Executing: /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable cron
```
* Cron jobs are recorded and managed in a special file known as a crontab. Each user profile on the system can have their own crontab where they can schedule jobs, which is stored under /var/spool/cron/crontabs/.
* To schedule a job, open up your crontab for editing and add a task written in the form of a cron expression. The syntax for cron expressions can be broken down into two elements: the schedule and the command to run.

script
```python
import time
from datetime import datetime as dt
import logging
import os
import signal
import sys

logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', filemode='a', format='%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)
logging.info('Starting...') # all logging will be logged to app.log
CUR = dt.now()
print(str(CUR), " Starting Cron job") # this will be logged to cron log
MAIN_PID = None

def handler(signum, frame):
    msg = "signal "+ str(signum)
    logging.info(msg)
    exit(1)

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handler)

def test_loop():
    rool= True
    count=0
    while (rool):
        count = count +1
        cur_tmp = dt.now()
        logging.info("Python count is " + str(cur_tmp))
        time.sleep(10)
        if count > 2:
            rool=False


if __name__ == "__main__":
    MAIN_PID = os.getpid()
    logging.info(str(MAIN_PID))
    test_loop()
    logging.info("Stopping....")
    cur_tmp = dt.now()
    print(str(cur_tmp), " Ending Cron job") # this will be logged to cron log
    exit(main())
```

Script
* /home/imsdal/run_loop.py
* Run the script with python3 run_loop.py
* cron log, >> /home/imsdal/cronoutput.log


Set up as cron jobb

```bash
crontab -e
# This will ask you which editor choose from. I used nano since it is my favorite editor, 1 = nano.
# Choose 1-4 [1]: 1
* * * * * python3 /home/imsdal/run_loop.py >> /home/imsdal/cronoutput.log
crontab: installing new crontab
# So the first 5 stars you can mention the minute, hour, day and month etc. with command to be executed. 
# Let’s create a cronjob that run every minute with out python script.
```

Let's view the outpu of each log file

```bash
cat cronoutput.log

tail -f cronoutput.log
```
