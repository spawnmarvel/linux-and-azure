# Stack for log monitoring, Telegraf, Loki and Grafana

Telegraf as your log collector instead of Logstash, you'll still need a backend storage and indexing solution, as well as a visualization tool.
If you are already using Grafana and are looking for a cost-effective and relatively simple setup, Telegraf + Grafana Loki is a great option.



## Telegraf

## Loki

Grafana Loki is a set of open source components that can be composed into a fully featured logging stack. A small index and highly compressed chunks simplifies the operation and significantly lowers the cost of Loki.
