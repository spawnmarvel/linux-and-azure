## To integrate the Telegraf Disk Input Plugin with the Zabbix Output Plugin

To integrate the Telegraf Disk Input Plugin with the Zabbix Output Plugin, you'll need to configure Telegraf to collect disk metrics and then send these metrics to a Zabbix server. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set this up:

### Step 1: Install Telegraf
Ensure Telegraf is installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official InfluxData repository or through package managers like `apt` or `yum` depending on your OS.

### Step 2: Configure Disk Input Plugin

Edit the Telegraf configuration file, typically located at `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` or similar, to include the disk input plugin:

```toml
[[inputs.disk]]
  # By default, Telegraf will gather stats for all mount points
  # If you want to limit to specific mount points, uncomment and edit the following:
  # mount_points = ["/", "/home"]

  # Ignore certain filesystem types
  ignore_fs = ["tmpfs", "devtmpfs", "devfs", "iso9660", "overlay", "aufs", "squashfs"]

  # Optionally, ignore based on mount options
  # ignore_mount_opts = []
```


### Step 3: Configure Zabbix Output Plugin

Add or modify the Zabbix output plugin configuration in the same `telegraf.conf` file:

```toml
[[outputs.zabbix]]
  ## Zabbix server address
  
  ## Address and (optional) port of the Zabbix server
  address = "your_zabbix_server_ip:10051"

  ## Add prefix to all keys sent to Zabbix.
  key_prefix = "telegraf."

  ## If true, the agent will send all data in one packet per interval
  # use_batch_format = true
```

If we do not specify data_format for  ## data_format = "json" for [[inputs.disk]], [[outputs.file]] and [[outputs.zabbix]], we get:


```log

#  [[outputs.file]]

disk,device=C:,fstype=NTFS,host=vmname02,mode=rw,path=\C: total=135839870976i,free=98685165568i,used=37154705408i,used_percent=27.35184091463429,inodes_total=0i,inodes_free=0i,inodes_used=0i,inodes_used_percent=0 1731677940000000000

file,host=vmname02 rpm=33,speed=200 1731677940000000000. What should the item name for the trappers be in zabbix to recieve data?"

Answer:





Replace `your_zabbix_server_ip` with the IP address or hostname of your Zabbix server.

### Step 4: Zabbix Server Configuration

1. **Create a Host in Zabbix**: Ensure you have a host configured in Zabbix that corresponds to the machine running Telegraf. 

2. **Zabbix Agent Configuration**: If you're using passive checks, ensure your Zabbix server is set up to listen on the port you specified in Telegraf's output plugin (default is 10051).

3. **Items in Zabbix**: You might not need to manually create items for each disk metric if you're using Zabbix's auto-discovery features or if Telegraf sends metrics with keys that Zabbix can automatically recognize. However, if specific items are needed:

   - Go to the host configuration in Zabbix.
   - Add new items with keys like `system.disk.free`, `system.disk.used`, etc., which should match the metrics sent by Telegraf.

### Step 5: Start or Restart Telegraf

After configuring, start or restart the Telegraf service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart telegraf
```

or if not using systemd:

```bash
sudo service telegraf restart
```

### Step 6: Verify Data Flow

- **Check Telegraf Logs**: Look at Telegraf's logs for any errors or to confirm that data is being collected and sent:

  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/telegraf/telegraf.log
  ```

- **Zabbix Frontend**: Check in Zabbix to ensure that data from Telegraf is arriving. You should see the disk metrics under the latest data for the configured host.

### Additional Tips:

- **Security**: Ensure that the communication between Telegraf and Zabbix is secure, especially if over a network. Consider using TLS if your setup requires secure transmission.

- **Performance**: Monitor the performance impact on your system when collecting disk metrics, especially if you're monitoring many mount points or doing so very frequently.

This setup will allow you to monitor disk usage through Zabbix, leveraging Telegraf's ability to gather system metrics efficiently.

# How to view incoming telegraf items on the zabbix server?

## To view incoming Telegraf items on the Zabbix server, follow these steps:

### 1. **Ensure Data is Being Sent**
Before diving into Zabbix, make sure that Telegraf is successfully sending data to Zabbix. You can check this by:

- Looking at Telegraf's logs for successful sends or errors.
- Using tools like `tcpdump` or `Wireshark` on the Zabbix server to capture incoming traffic on the Zabbix agent port (typically 10051 for passive checks).

### 2. **Zabbix Web Interface**

- **Check Latest Data:**
  - Go to **Monitoring** > **Latest data**.
  - Select the host that corresponds to the machine where Telegraf is running.
  - Here, you should see all the items (metrics) that Zabbix is receiving, including those from Telegraf. If you've configured Telegraf to send with a specific prefix, you can filter by that prefix.

- **Configuration of Items:**
  - If items are not automatically created or if you need to customize them:
    - Navigate to **Configuration** > **Hosts**.
    - Find and click on the host you're interested in.
    - Go to the **Items** tab.
    - Here, you can see all items associated with this host. If Telegraf items are not listed, you might need to:
      - **Create new items** manually by clicking on **Create item**. Use the keys as they are sent by Telegraf (e.g., `system.disk.free`, etc.). Ensure the type is set to **Zabbix agent** or **Zabbix agent (active)** depending on your setup.
      - **Use Low-level discovery** if you want Zabbix to automatically create items based on discovery rules.

### 3. **Using Zabbix API**

If you prefer or need to automate or script this process:

- You can use the Zabbix API to fetch items. Here's a basic example using Python with the `pyzabbix` library:

```python
from pyzabbix import ZabbixAPI

# Connect to Zabbix Server
zapi = ZabbixAPI("http://your_zabbix_server/zabbix")
zapi.login("username", "password")

# Get items for a specific host
hostid = zapi.host.get(filter={"host": "YourHostName"}, output=["hostid"])[0]["hostid"]
items = zapi.item.get(hostids=[hostid], output=["itemid", "key_", "name"])

for item in items:
    print(f"Item Key: {item['key_']}, Item Name: {item['name']}")
```

Replace `"http://your_zabbix_server/zabbix"`, `"username"`, `"password"`, and `"YourHostName"` with your actual Zabbix server details and host name.

### 4. **Troubleshooting**

- **Item Status**: If items are not updating, check their status in Zabbix. Disabled or unsupported items won't collect data.
- **Zabbix Agent Configuration**: Ensure the Zabbix agent on the server side is configured to accept passive checks if that's how Telegraf is configured to send data.

### 5. **Graphs and Screens**

- Once the data is flowing, you can create graphs or screens in Zabbix to visualize the disk usage over time:
  - Go to **Monitoring** > **Graphs** or **Screens** to set these up based on the items you're now receiving from Telegraf.

By following these steps, you should be able to view and manage the metrics sent by Telegraf within the Zabbix environment.

### 5. Zabbix Server Log:

The Zabbix Server log can provide insights into the processing of received data, including any errors or warnings related to Telegraf items.

Location: The location of the Zabbix Server log file depends on your installation (e.g., /var/log/zabbix/zabbix_server.log).
Filtering: You can use grep or similar tools to filter the log for specific keywords related to Telegraf or the items you're interested in. For example, you could search for the hostname of the Telegraf agent or the item keys.
Troubleshooting: The log can help identify issues such as communication errors, incorrect data types, or problems with item configuration.
5. Using the zabbix_get Command (for Troubleshooting):

The zabbix_get command-line utility can be used to retrieve the current value of an item directly from the Zabbix Server.

Syntax: zabbix_get -s <Zabbix_Server_IP_or_Hostname> -p <Zabbix_Server_Port> -k <Item_Key>
Example: zabbix_get -s 192.168.1.100 -p 10050 -k disk.used_percent[/]
Purpose: This is primarily for troubleshooting and quickly verifying if Zabbix is receiving data for a specific item.
Tips for Effective Monitoring:

Organize with Applications: Group your Telegraf items into applications within Zabbix for easier management and filtering.
Use Meaningful Item Names: Give your items descriptive names to make it easier to understand what they represent.
Create Graphs for Visualization: Create custom graphs to visualize the data and identify trends over time.
Set Up Triggers and Alerts: Define triggers to monitor specific thresholds and configure alerts to be notified of potential issues.
By leveraging these methods, you can effectively monitor the items sent by Telegraf to your Zabbix server, ensure data is being received correctly, and gain insights into the performance of your systems. Let me know if you need further clarification or have any other questions!
