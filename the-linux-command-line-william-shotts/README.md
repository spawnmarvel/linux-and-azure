## Learning the Shell

One of our software engineers spent a couple of hours writing a C++ program that would look through all the user's directories and add up the space they were using and make a listing of the results.


When I heard about the problem, I realized I could perform this task with this single line:

```bash
du -s * | sort -nr > $HOME/user_space_report.txt
```

### 1 What is "the Shell"?

You're not operating as root, are you?

Unless you absolutely need administrative privileges, do not operate as the superuser.

### 2 Navigation

```bash
# work dir
pwd

# list files
ls

# go to
cd

# working dir
cd .

# parent dir
cd ..

# home 
cd ~

```
