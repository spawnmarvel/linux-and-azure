# Security of Ubuntu

## Secure out of the box

All Canonical products are built with unrivalled security in mind â€” and tested to ensure they deliver it. Your Ubuntu software is secure from the moment you install it, and will remain so as Canonical ensures security updates are always available on Ubuntu first.

## Hardening at scale

The default configuration of Ubuntu LTS releases balances between usability, performance and security. However, non general purpose systems can be further hardened to reduce their attack surface. Canonical provides certified tooling for automated audit and hardening. Comply with widely accepted industry hardening profiles, including CIS and DISA-STIG.

## Certified compliance

Canonical offers a range of tools to enable organisations to manage their desktop fleet and cloud with specific compliance requirements. A FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) certified version of Ubuntu is also available to comply to US government standards.
